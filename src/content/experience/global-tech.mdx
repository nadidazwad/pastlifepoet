# Scaling Frontend Architecture

During my time at Global Tech, I led the transition from a monolithic frontend to a scalable micro-frontend architecture. This allowed our teams to deploy independently and reduced build times by 60%.

## Achievements

- Architected a shared component library used by 50+ internal teams.
- Optimized LCP across all core products, improving conversion by 15%.
- Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline for frontend deployments.

<Callout type="info">
  The micro-frontend transition involved orchestrating 15 separate applications into a single cohesive user experience.

## Code Snippet

```typescript
// Micro-frontend loader implementation
const loadMicroFrontend = async (name: string, url: string) => {
  const script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = `${url}/remoteEntry.js`;
  document.head.appendChild(script);
  // ... initialization logic
};
```
