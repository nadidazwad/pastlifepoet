# From 0 to 1: Building the Foundation

As the first engineering hire at Startup X, I was responsible for building the entire technical stack from scratch. I worked closely with the founders to define the product vision and execute the initial MVP.

## Key Milestones

- Built the initial MVP in 3 months, leading to a successful seed round.
- Scaled the platform to handle 100k+ monthly active users.
- Hired and managed the first 5 engineers.

  Being a founding engineer requires wearing many hats, from DevOps to Product Design.
